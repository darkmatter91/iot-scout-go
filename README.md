```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/darkmatter91/iot-scout.git
cd iot-scout
```

2. Build the project:
```bash
go build -o iot_scout
```

3. Make the binary executable:
```bash
chmod +x iot_scout
```

## Usage

Run the tool:
```bash
./iot_scout
```

### Menu Options

1. **Capture live data from UART** (Currently under maintenance)
   - Connects to IoT devices via UART
   - Monitors running processes
   - Analyzes system information

2. **Analyze firmware**
   - Extracts and analyzes firmware files
   - Identifies binary files and their types
   - Detects common IoT components

3. **Search for sensitive information**
   - Scans for passwords, keys, and tokens
   - Identifies configuration files
   - Detects network information

4. **Generate report**
   - Creates detailed markdown reports
   - Includes all findings and analyses
   - Time-stamped for documentation

5. **Exit**
   - Gracefully exits the program

## Report Format

Reports are generated in Markdown format with the following sections:

- Process List
- Firmware Analysis
- IoT Binaries
- Sensitive Information

Reports are saved with the filename format: `iot_scout_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md`

## Sensitive Information Detection

The tool searches for various types of sensitive information:

- Passwords and credentials
- API keys and tokens
- Private keys and certificates
- Configuration files
- Network information
- Email addresses
- IP addresses
- MAC addresses
- URLs
